            <p>At The New Freedom Worship Center, our mission is to shine the light of Christ by grounding our faith in the infallible, inspired Scriptures, which guide all aspects of our doctrine and practice (1 Timothy 3:16). We are a community of believers who have accepted Jesus Christ as Savior, been baptized by immersion, and are committed to holy living through sanctification by the blood, Spirit, and Word. Our covenant emphasizes love, acceptance, and forgiveness, ministering to all without prejudice, as we strive to reflect God’s grace. We believe in the deity of Christ, His virgin birth, atonement, and resurrection, and we eagerly await His premillennial return, trusting in the rapture of the church and the promise of new heavens and a new earth (2 Peter 3:13).</p>

            <p>We are dedicated to fostering a vibrant worship environment where the presence of God is felt through joyous praise and reverent service. Every believer is indwelled by the Holy Spirit at regeneration, and we encourage all to be filled with the Spirit for empowered service and abundant joy (Ephesians 5:18). Our ministry embraces the gifts and fruit of the Spirit, ensuring that true salvation manifests in Christian character (Galatians 5:22-23). We uphold regular practices like the Lord’s Supper, foot washing as an act of humility, and systematic giving to support God’s work, all while cultivating a servant spirit that aids one another in prayer, sickness, and distress.</p>

            <p>New Freedom Worship Center stands firm in its belief in the Holy Trinity—Father, Son, and Holy Ghost—and the redemptive work of Christ for humanity’s fall, as recorded in Genesis. We proclaim healing for the body, the resurrection of the dead, and the eternal judgment of the wicked, while holding fast to the hope of Christ’s millennial reign and the eternal kingdom. Our commitment to water baptism, holy living, and avoiding worldly conformity shapes our community as we seek to build lives that honor God, edify the church, and bring light to a world in need of His love and truth.</p>
