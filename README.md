# NFWC
The New Freedom Worship Center 
A freelance Website for a local church, My first commit is about a quarter of the way through the website. I changed github accounts at this point and was smart and pushed my work.


The goal was to make a website so that this church could improve its following in the community. I have added things like Social links to thier youtube & facebook. I tried for a professional feel with bright color design. The client is very adamant about bible scripture so I tried to include plenty along with images of thier church.
